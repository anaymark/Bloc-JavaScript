### Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before:

### What are the steps involved in making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
>Gather ingredients->Take 2 pieces of bread->Apply Peanut Butter to one slice->Apply Jam to other slice->Combine slices->Cut Crust?->if yes, get knife cut crust->if no->end

### What are the steps involved in tying a shoelace?
>decide on lace type->Bunny Ear Method->Fold each end of the lace into a single "bunny ear->Cross the bunny ears so that they form an "X" in the air->Loop the bottom bunny ear over and through the top bunny ear->Pull the bunny ears out to the side away from the shoe->end

### What are the steps involved in making a cup of coffee?
>decide instant or machine->machine add water to machine reservoir->choose type of coffee->measure out appropriate amount->place into the coffee reservoir of coffee machine->follow machine brewing instructions->end

### What are the steps involved in making a phone call?
>locate phone->open dialer or contacts application->if dialer, enter phone number->hit call button->if contacts application, find contact->click on contact->select call from menu of options->end

### In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the problem?

Start at the very end and work backwards to identify the issue. Breakdown the issue into steps, in this example we have 3. Further break down into micro view if needed. Continue to work backwards. 


### What would the roadmap for narrowing down the Say Hi problem look like?
>Start backwards at Say Hi! step->if still broken, inspect User Button Click->if still broken, inspect initial step, of User Name Input->if still broken, inspect application blueprint

### Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.
>Internet on computer not working->Start at computer level->check Wi-Fi card and settings->if no problem->check router/modem settings->if settings are correct->reset router/modem->if problem persists->call ISP->end
