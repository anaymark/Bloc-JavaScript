# What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes or camels)

* :camel:Case

# If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?

* var mentor = 'name'; 
* var mentor = "name";
* var mentor = `name`;
* var mentor = mentorName;

# How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?

* console.log(mentor);

# Describe the difference between let, var, and const.

* let allows to scope variables to a portion of a funciton (particular block or curly braces). Let will allow the varibale to be reassigned. This is typically used in the cases of iteration such as for-loop and when writing mathematical programs.  

* var will scope the variable to the entire function. Var will also allow reassignment. 

* const is used in the cases to declare a variable that will not be reassigned. This is used when something you are declaring will not change over time. 

# JS

```
const name = "Alex";

var state = "Colorado";

let hairColor = "Brown";
